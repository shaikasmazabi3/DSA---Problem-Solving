Atlassian offers an 60-80 LPA CTC, and the remote job hype was unmatched. 🔥

Online Assessment
The OA consisted of 2 medium and 1 hard DSA problems.
Questions were based on sliding window, binary search on answer, and graph traversal.
The candidate managed to solve all three and cleared the round.

Onsite Round 1
Started with core CS fundamentals — caching vs. database lookups, process vs. thread.

Faced a binary tree traversal problem with constraints.

Provided a working solution, though not fully optimized.
 ➡️ Still advanced to the next stage.

Onsite Round 2
A low-level design discussion with an interviewer from the platform team.
Since the candidate had backend-focused projects on their resume, this left a strong impression.
The round went fairly smooth.
